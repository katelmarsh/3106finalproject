# Comparing Movie Reviews Before and After COVID-19 Lockdown 

Vivian Liu and Kate Marsh's final project for STAT3106 Applied Data Mining at Columbia University in Spring 2021. The project specifications are [here](https://leewtai.github.io/courses/data_mining/homeworks/proj3.html). 

We took movie review data from IMDB and New York Times and compared sentiments for different genres before and after COVID-19 Lockdown started in March 2020. We were interested in how different genres that traditionally are rated differently by the general public vs professional movie critics (such as documentaries, action movies, and dramas) might have changed after the strike of the pandemic and the cultural shifts that accompanied it. 

Data was found at the two following sources: 
- [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)
- [NYT Movie Reviews](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview)

The final_project.Rmd contains the code for this project in full. Data will not be available in this repository but can be accessed using the links above.
